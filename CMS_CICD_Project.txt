truYum is a leading restaurant chain that operates 50+ restaurants across the country. Due to successful business model and solid understanding about consumer needs, the truYum executive management feels that they can increase their business by going online and delivery food to the door steps of the customer.  

They are planning to open an online portal called truYum through which they want to reach out a larger customer base. 

For this Front End Portal, the development team wants to develop a strong middle ware layer exposed as Microservices REST End Points so that the web portal can service its customers accordingly. 

1)Menu Microservice
Menu Service holds the list of menu items that are serviced by the Yum Restaurant. 
Menu Items are exposed by this service. 

2)Order Microservice
Once the customer logs in, they view the Menu and can make an order. Order Details are persisted using this service. 

Task to be done:
----------------
1)Package the services, create docker containers for these services.
2)Create a front end application for these services and integrate  frontend and backend in docker containers.
3)Create a CI/CD pipeline in jenkins for these services.
The pipeline stages should include pull scm,build,test,code analysis with sonarqube,create docker image,run in docker container,push to docker hub.
4)Deploy one service is kubernetes.
